# HTMLProject

A personal project that I started while learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is a website that is mainly used to experiment on things such as user accesibility, the 
boundless options present in these three languages, as well as any creative website based endeavours that I have. 

Not all images are owned by me.
